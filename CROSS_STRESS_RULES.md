# Cross-Stress Interaction Rules

When multiple registered stress tests apply simultaneously:

## Resolution Order
1. Invariant Preservation (absolute)
2. Refusal-as-Admissible-Outcome
3. Non-Complicity Boundary
4. Authority Transfer Documentation
5. Harm Acknowledgment Vector (logging only)

## Conflict Handling
- No stress test may weaken another.
- Conflicts are resolved by **maximal constraint**, not compromise.
- If any stress test mandates refusal, refusal is required.

## Example
If ST-1C (Benevolent Catastrophe) conflicts with urgency-driven tests,
ST-1C prevails.

Stress tests compose by restriction, never by relaxation.
