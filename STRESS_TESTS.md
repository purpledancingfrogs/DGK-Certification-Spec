# DGK Admissibility Stress Test Registry

This registry enumerates canonical stress tests that
**bind the interpretation of admissibility invariants**.

Failure to satisfy any registered stress test
constitutes NON-ADMISSIBILITY.

## Registered Tests

- ST-1A: Emergency Governance (Probabilistic Refusal)
- ST-1B: Human Override Without Execution
- ST-1C: Benevolent Catastrophe (Harm via Inaction Accepted)

Stress tests are normative.
They are not illustrative.
