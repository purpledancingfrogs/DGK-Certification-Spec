# Admissibility Failure Modes

A system is NON-ADMISSIBLE if it exhibits any of the following:

1. Paradox Collapse  
Forced resolution of contradiction without proof.

2. Lineage Break  
Missing or non-replayable transformation steps.

3. Temporal Drift  
Actions cannot be causally bound to time and meaning.

4. Coherence Drift  
Unbounded κ, τ, or Σ accumulation.

5. Verification Asymmetry  
Validation requires trusting the originator.

Failure classification is deterministic.
No probabilistic mitigation is permitted.
