# DGK Admissibility Invariants

A system or decision is **ADMISSIBLE** iff all invariants hold.

## Core Invariants

1. Paradox Preservation  
Contradictions MUST NOT be collapsed or probabilistically resolved.

2. Deterministic Lineage  
All transformations MUST be replayable and traceable.

3. κ–τ–Σ Coherence  
Ethical (κ), temporal (τ), and systemic risk (Σ) drift MUST be bounded.

4. Temporal–Meaning Binding  
Every action MUST bind to time, meaning, and consequence.

5. Epistemic Hygiene  
Verification MUST be possible without trusting the originator.

Failure of ANY invariant ⇒ NON-ADMISSIBLE.

## Stress-Test Binding Clause

All admissibility invariants MUST hold under
registered stress-test conditions.

In particular:

- Benevolent intent does NOT relax invariants.
- Human authorization does NOT override invariants.
- Visible harm from refusal is admissible.
- Complicity under invariant violation is prohibited.
