# Refusal as Admissible Outcome

Refusal to act is an admissible outcome when and only when:
- Action violates one or more invariants
- Certification cannot be completed in time
- Execution would imply system complicity

In such cases:
- Harm via inaction is admissible
- Refusal MUST emit formal artifacts
- Authority transfer MUST be documented

Refusal is a valid, certifiable system action.
